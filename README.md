#### A Swift-er way to do [GCD](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Performance/Reference/GCD_libdispatch_Ref/index.html)-related things.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

```ruby
pod 'Do' # Latest Swift compatible
pod 'Do/2.0' # Swift 2.0 compatible
pod 'Do/1.2' # Swift 1.2 compatible
```

### Manual

Drag Do-[Swift version].swift into your project.

## Usage

### Queues

***Do!*** provides easy access to the main queue, global priority queues, as well as the global 'quality of service' queues available in `OS X 10.10` and `iOS 8.0` and later (with appropriate fallbacks in place).

```swift
Do.mainQueue // The "main" dispatch queue.

Do.highPriorityQueue // The global "high priority" dispatch queue.

Do.defaultQueue // The global "default" dispatch queue.

Do.lowPriorityQueue // The global "low priority" dispatch queue.

Do.backgroundQueue // The global "background" dispatch queue.

Do.userInteractiveQueue // The global "user interactive" (super high priority?) dispatch queue.

Do.userInitiatedQueue // The global "user initiated" (equivalent to "high priority") dispatch queue.

Do.utilityQueue // The global "utility" (equivalent to "low priority") dispatch queue.
```

***Do!*** also provides a way to check whether you are currently dispatched on a specific queue by comparing labels (give your queues labels!).

```swift
if Do.isCurrentQueue(mainQueue) {
    print("Hello from the main queue!")
}
```
### Sync

***Do!*** provides a wrapper around `dispatch_sync` and `dispatch_barrier_sync` that is succinct and deadlock safe (well, *more* deadlock safe â€“ it uses `Do.isCurrentQueue` to avoid this, but that only helps if you try to dispatch to the current queue, not one higher up in the dispatch tree).

```swift
Do.sync(someSerialQueue) {
    print("Hello world!")
}
```

```swift
Do.barrierSync(someConcurrentQueue) {
    print("Hello world!")
}
```

More importantly, ***Do!*** provides versions which returns values, which is perfect for synchronizing access to resources.

```swift
let resource: Resource = Do.sync(someSerialQueue) {
    // .. heavy work that should happen serially...
    
    return importantResource
}
```

```swift
let resource: Resource = Do.barrierSync(someConcurrentQueue) {
    // .. heavy work that should block queue...
    
    return importantResource
}
```

### Loop

***Do!*** provides a wrapper around `dispatch_apply` that is succinct and deadlock safe (again, *more* deadlock safe). If the targetted queue is the current dispatch queue (or nil), it reverts to a plain loop.

```swift
Do.loop(100, highPriorityQueue) { i in
    print(i)
}
```

```swift
Do.loop(10) { i in
    print(i)
}
```

***Do!*** also provides a version which takes a range instead of an iterations count.

```swift
Do.loop(15..<55, highPriorityQueue) { i in
    print(i)
}
```

### After

***Do!*** provides a wrapper around `dispatch_after` that is succinct, defaults to the main queue, and returns a block for cancellation of the scheduled dispatch.

```swift
Do.after(3.0) {
    print("Hello world!")
}
```

```swift
Do.after(0.5, backgroundQueue) {
    print("Hello world!")
}
```

```swift
let cancel = Do.after(10) {
    print("Hello world!")
}

Do.after(2) {
    cancel()
}
```
